# Course Registration

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### I have used the states in this assignment in the following manner:

<p>I have used a state for loading the data of each course. Initially, I store the data in an empty array. I load the data using the useEffect hook. Then, if someone selects a particular course, I maintain a state for the selected course. Similarly, if someone purchases a course, I keep track of the course's duration using another state. In this way, I have utilized all these states.</p>
